# PIANO Progress

Compact project memory as of 2026-04-29.

## Current Snapshot

Latest pushed commit:

```text
c058c8b Add Stage B contact weight sweep script
```

Tracked git state was clean at compaction time. Root memory docs and
`analyses/` are ignored locally, so edits there do not appear in normal
`git status`.

Current Stage B best server checkpoint identifier. The local workspace may only
have eval summaries, not the `.pt` file:

```text
runs/training/generator_v12_decoded_contact_w02_diagnostics/best_val.pt
```

Matched 80-clip contact eval:

| Row | mean_min_dist_per_frame |
|---|---:|
| GT original | 13.09 cm |
| GT VQ roundtrip | 18.47 cm |
| v12 w02 best_val full | 31.82 cm |
| v12 w02 best_val text_only | 64.85 cm |
| v12 w02 best_val swap | 74.01 cm |

Bottom line: Stage B has a real `z_int` signal, but current training strategy is
stuck far above GT roundtrip. The next step is diagnosis, not another contact
weight tweak.

2026-04-29 follow-up analysis: the problem is likely not missing contact
supervision. The current loss already includes base CE, residual CE, and a
decoded contact auxiliary term through the full soft RVQ path. The failure mode
is more specific: the soft/teacher-forced decoded contact surrogate improves,
but the discrete sample-time path (MaskGIT base sampling, residual generation,
VQ decode) remains near the same contact band. External HOI/control work points
to closing this sample-time geometric loop with reranking, guidance, hard/ST
sampling consistency, or explicit intermediate contact/joint representations.

## Stage Status

Stage 1 pseudo-labels:

- Current InterAct label track: v11.
- Important fields: contact body part, closest-surface target xyz,
  3-class phase, support state, object pose in canonical/body frame.
- Durable doc: `analyses/pseudo_label_pipeline.md`.

Stage A Interaction Predictor:

- Shipped state: v6.
- Predictor of record: server checkpoint `runs/training/predictor/final.pt`
  (local sync may only include eval JSONs).
- Durable doc: `analyses/stageA_design.md`.
- Revisit only if downstream diagnostics show Stage A labels/predictions are
  the limiting factor.

Stage B Motion Generator:

- Active bottleneck.
- Current implementation includes residual `z_int` conditioning and decoded
  contact auxiliary loss through full soft RVQ prediction.
- Main training script: `src/piano/training/train_generator.py`.
- Main model wrapper: `src/piano/models/motion_generator.py`.
- Decoded contact loss: `src/piano/training/decoded_contact_loss.py`.
- Current sweep runner:
  `scripts/stage_b_generator/run_v12_contact_weight_sweep.sh`.
- Current no-retrain diagnostic runner:
  `scripts/stage_b_generator/k_sample_oracle.py`.
- Durable doc: `analyses/stageB_compact.md`.

Stage C Joint Finetune:

- Not started.
- Do not start until Stage B diagnostic bottleneck is understood.

## Stage B Evidence Timeline

| Step | Result | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| v0.1 | initial `z_int` adapter, weak visual effect | needed object pose |
| v0.2 | object pose added, token signal up but body mostly in place | inspect MoMask path |
| v0.3/v0.4 | MoMask encoder normalization bug fixed | first major correction |
| B0 | contact metric introduced; v0.4 full 20.86 vs GT roundtrip 11.29 on canonical 5 | measure contact, not mp4 vibes |
| v0.5 | lower CE but worse contact | CE is misaligned |
| v0.6 | per-head gamma improved canonical 5 to 16.03 | useful but limited |
| v0.7 | mirror augmentation regressed to 29.50 | data symmetry not the fix |
| v0.3-delta | trainable-copy variant regressed after dead-init fix | architecture swap exhausted |
| B1 | contact checkpointing exposed CE/contact decoupling | useful diagnostic, not enough |
| B3 | inference guidance mixed wins/losses | base logits unstable |
| C1/v0.8 | residual `z_int` alone: 43.62 full | not enough |
| C2/v0.9 | decoded contact aux: 29.19 full on 20 clips | real control signal |
| C2b/v0.10 | full-RVQ path: 25.27 full on 20 clips | partial gain |
| v0.11 | diagnostics showed weight 0.10 had small gradient share | motivated sweep |
| v0.12 | weights 0.20/0.30/0.50/0.80 all near 32 cm on 80 clips | stop blind weight sweeps |

## v0.12 Details

Runner:

```bash
bash scripts/stage_b_generator/run_v12_contact_weight_sweep.sh
```

Default weights:

```text
decoded_contact_aux.weight = 0.20, 0.30, 0.50, 0.80
```

Best 80-clip result by full contact:

| Rank | checkpoint | full |
|---:|---|---:|
| 1 | w02 best_val | 31.82 |
| 2 | w08 final | 32.17 |
| 3 | w03 best_contact | 32.39 |
| 4 | w02 final | 32.51 |

Gradient diagnostic:

| weight | decoded grad median | final decoded loss | best full |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.20 | 5.57% | 0.1558 | 31.82 |
| 0.30 | 7.97% | 0.1340 | 32.39 |
| 0.50 | 13.02% | 0.1128 | 32.87 |
| 0.80 | 19.27% | 0.0988 | 32.17 |

Conclusion: decoded-contact surrogate optimization is working mechanically, but
it does not translate monotonically to sample-time contact.

Subset decomposition for v12 w02 best_val:

| subset | GT orig | GT roundtrip | full | codebook gap | model gap |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| chairs | 12.04 | 12.09 | 19.07 | 0.05 | 6.98 |
| imhd | 8.41 | 22.55 | 42.30 | 14.13 | 19.75 |
| neuraldome | 14.80 | 19.30 | 33.63 | 4.50 | 14.33 |
| omomo_correct_v2 | 17.11 | 19.95 | 32.27 | 2.84 | 12.32 |

The old "codebook is negligible" conclusion only held on the canonical 5 clips.
On 80 clips, IMHD has a large roundtrip/codebook issue.

## Next Work

Implement and run no-retrain diagnostics:

1. K-sample oracle on v12 w02 best_val.
2. Soft-hard gap diagnostic between decoded training surrogate and discrete
   generated contact.
3. RVQ mixed oracle.
4. Subset-specific codebook audit, with IMHD first.

After those results:

- If K-sample oracle finds good contact, add sampling/reranking or guidance.
- If GT base + predicted residual fails but predicted base + GT residual works,
  focus base-token prediction.
- If predicted base + GT residual fails, focus residual/full-RVQ path.
- If GT roundtrip is bad on a subset, investigate codebook/representation for
  that subset before more generator training.

## Environment

Server:

```bash
cd /media/gpu-server-1/4TB_for_data/Cai/PIANO/PIANO
conda activate piano
```

Local workspace:

```text
e:\Project\2026-04-13
```

Local tests should use the `piano` conda environment when possible.
